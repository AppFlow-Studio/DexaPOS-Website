-- Replace inline (merchants JOIN members WHERE user_id = current_user_id())
-- subqueries on order_items + order_payments RLS with the cached
-- (SELECT user_merchant_id()) pattern already used on order_discounts /
-- order_item_modifiers. Inline join was being re-evaluated per row,
-- causing 8-15s mean times on PostgREST nested-embed reads
-- (orders + order_items + ...).
--
-- Functionally equivalent: user_merchant_id() is STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
-- and resolves the same merchants→members lookup once per query, then
-- the planner caches it.
