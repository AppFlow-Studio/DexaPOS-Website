-- Wave D — per-payment SC tracking. Mirrors the dual_pricing_fee /
-- refunded_dual_pricing_fee pair already on this table:
--
--   service_charge           — snapshot of this payment's share of
--                              orders.service_charge at the moment
--                              process_payment_v13 inserted the row.
--                              For a non-split full payment this equals
--                              orders.service_charge. For a partial /
--                              split / item payment it's proportional to
--                              v_payment_total / orders.card_total, with
--                              the last split-portion snapping to gross
--                              so SUM(service_charge) across all payments
--                              equals orders.service_charge exactly.
--
--   service_charge_refunded  — cumulative SC portion reversed by
--                              apply_refund_to_payment_v4. LEAST-clamped
--                              on partial refunds, snapped to gross on
--                              full void / final refund. Drift invariant:
--                              service_charge_refunded ≤ service_charge.
--
-- Legacy rows pre-dating Wave D get the DEFAULT 0 for both columns. v4
-- multiplies by service_charge in its delta, so a zero snapshot means
-- the row contributes nothing to SC reversal — clean fall-through with
-- no special-casing required.
