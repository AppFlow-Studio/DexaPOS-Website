-- Local:  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/rollback/20260910120100_seat_guests_v4_rollback.sql
-- Remote: paste into the Supabase SQL editor and execute.
--
-- Safe at any time: seat_guests_v3 is untouched and the client falls back to
-- it whenever EXPO_PUBLIC_CLIENT_IDS is unset. Sessions and orders already
-- written with client-minted ids keep them — identity never changes.
--
-- NOTE: v4 is the only caller of create_order_v4 on the server side. Dropping
-- v4 here does NOT require dropping create_order_v4, which the client also
-- calls directly.
