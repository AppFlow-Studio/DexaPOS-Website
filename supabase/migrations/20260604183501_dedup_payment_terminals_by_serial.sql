-- Prevent duplicate payment_terminals rows for the same physical device.
--
-- Background: the Add Castles USB wizard re-INSERTs on every run instead of
-- upserting because the client dedup query uses .maybeSingle(), which returns
-- data: null when 2+ rows already match. Once the first duplicate sneaks in,
-- every later registration compounds the problem.
--
-- This migration:
--   1. Merges existing duplicate groups (same location_id + serial_number)
--      into a single winner row, repointing all FK references first.
--   2. Adds a partial unique index that forbids future duplicates at the DB
--      level — defence in depth for the client-side dedup fix.
--
-- Winner per group: the row with is_active=true (preferred) and the most
-- recent updated_at. Other rows in the group are "losers".
--
-- FK columns referencing payment_terminals.id (verified via pg_constraint):
--   device_inventory.linked_payment_terminal_id  (no ON DELETE action)
--   kiosk_profiles.payment_terminal_id            (ON DELETE SET NULL)
--   settlement_batches.payment_terminal_id        (ON DELETE SET NULL)
--   station_devices.payment_terminal_id           (ON DELETE SET NULL)
--
-- settlement_batches collision: the wave_b1 partial unique index
-- (payment_terminal_id, merchant_id, acquirer, batch_number) WHERE batch_number IS NOT NULL
-- forbids two rows for the same terminal with the same host batch_number.
-- In the duplicate-terminal world this constraint held trivially because
-- each terminal_id had its own host-keyed namespace. After we collapse the
-- duplicates, multiple historical batches that happened to recycle the same
-- TSYS batch_number (e.g. "011" recycled monthly) would collide on the
-- winner. We pick one row per (winner, merchant, acquirer, batch_number) to
-- repoint — preferring the still-open one if any, otherwise the most recent —
-- and leave the rest on the loser terminal so that the DELETE at the bottom
-- triggers ON DELETE SET NULL on those rows. They keep their batch data; only
-- the terminal link goes null. For closed/settled batches that's a small loss
-- of attribution; the totals and payments inside the batch are untouched.
