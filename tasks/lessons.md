## Verify LIVE schema columns before writing DDL that references them (2026-07-14)
Context: auto-grant creator merchant access trigger.
Mistake: I built the trigger's `INSERT INTO admin_merchant_access (... access_level ...)`
from `utils/migrations/017_admin_merchant_access.sql`, which defines `access_level`.
The LIVE table has NO `access_level` column (schema drift). The trigger threw at runtime,
which aborted the AFTER INSERT and rolled back the merchant insert → merchant never created →
"Failed to load merchant" (the exact bug we were fixing), and it broke ALL merchant creation.
Also caught: the `admin_merchant_access_no_self_grant` CHECK in the migration files is NOT
applied live either.

Rule: Before writing/inserting against a table, confirm its ACTUAL columns/constraints on the
target DB (`information_schema.columns`, `pg_constraint`) — do not trust repo migration files,
which can drift from the deployed schema. The ticket's own SQL omitted access_level; that was a
signal I should have matched.

Rule: A broken AFTER INSERT trigger silently breaks the parent insert. Test end-to-end (real
create flow), not just the guard logic, before calling a DB trigger done.
